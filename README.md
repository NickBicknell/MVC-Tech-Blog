## Description

This MVC Tech Blog application was created as a platform for users to make posts, and interact with other users posts. The development of this app has helped me become more familiar and experienced building a full stack application utilizing express routes, MySQL databases, express handlebars, and javascript to make an interactive and well assembled application.

## Installation

`npm i`

## Usage

When the user first opens the application, they will be greeted with the homepage of the website displaying posts users have created. From there they can either click on a post to view it, or login. If the user clicks on a post, they are greeted with the authors name, date created, their post, and the comments underneath it. You can leave comments once logged in. Once you login or signup, you are redirected to your dashboard. There you can create new posts or view your existing posts.
